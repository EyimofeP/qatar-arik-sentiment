"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha-Bangkok 29 Dec. 2022 on a B777-300ER. Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 – and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We purchased our package in March of 2022, scheduled for November 2022. There were three changes to our flight. The first was in August 2022. They stated the flight number and time was changed. We agreed to the changes. The next change was September 2022, they stated the flight numbers changed again. The last change was right before we left in October 2022. This time they changed our plane. When we originally chose our flight and seats we knew what the aircraft was. When they changed the plane, we did not. We called and spoke with several agents who were not helpful at all. Once I was able to get someone, they could not tell me the name of the updated aircraft. They just kept saying you have extra leg room seats. From all of the aircrafts I saw, there was no way the seat number I originally paid for on this new plane was extra leg room seats and I was right. When we got to our layover city, I was told that the plane was full and my seats were no longer available. They couldn't upgrade me or give me my money back.  I paid for these seats and I was not upgraded and I had to reach out to after I got home to request a refund. We went on the flight got there and had an awesome time in Maldives. However, coming back was the same, they put two planes that were not full together again and our seats were not available and we had to ride back with no extra leg room on a 12 hour flight. I have filed a report with Qatar requesting my money back on 20th November.  I send email after email, call after call and no help. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights and service were good as usual, with a high standard and service and catering. What is getting really bad is Doha airport. I departed from the dreaded bus gate area downstairs. It seems this becomes the norm now, since almost all my flights this year were bus transfers. It becomes more and more chaotic, but todays experience was really really bad. It was utter chaos with unorganized lines, frustrated and rude gate agents.  The shortage of buses added to the chaos. With this, Doha is miles away from becoming a world class airport."
"✅ Trip Verified | Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive"
Not Verified | It took 45 minutes from the plane stopping to get to the terminal.  Then a long chaotic security line. Not impressed at all. Almost missed our connecting flight. 
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is simply the best - from beginning to the end. The cabin is great with very spacious seats/beds. Extremely comfortable seats that turn into great beds that are made up by very helpful cabin personnel. The food was great and so was the selection. Especially the choices for breakfast were amazing. The restroom was spacious and very delicate. Service; as always on Qatar, excellent in all ways; smiling, correct and attentive. I don´t think there is anything better out there. Whether it is worth the price is a subjective thing. It was simply great."
"✅ Trip Verified | Great trip as always with Qatar. Seats are very comfortable, fully declining and easy to adjust. The seating arrangements are excellent offering both privacy or easy communication with your neighbour if not traveling alone. Great food, good selection - amazing how they manage. Crew, again as always, very attentive and smiling through the flight. You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle. Luggage pick up in Oslo somewhat of a disaster (long waiting) but that is due to no fault of the airline. Highly recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | From booking to landing, everything was smooth, easy, and convenient. The crew, whether on the ground or in the air were absolutely lovely and the offers of food, beverages and entertainment were stellar. The service was personalized and the air hostess would continually check in. The cabin was clean and the crew ensured the toilets were regularly checked. I have never been more comfortable on a 14 hour flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didn't come close to expectations."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page."
"✅ Trip Verified | Lousy lounge in CPT International. Small, cramped and badly aired. Fortunately the booked Q Suite was provided on the return flight which is really superb. Cabin Crew were also on the ball and provided 1st Class Service. Catering was however a disaster. There was only one starter available and it was inedible: “Creamy Quinoa and Edamame Salad”. Completely tasteless! For the mains 2 Chicken Dishes were on offer. (So much for variety!). I chose the Creamy Chicken Roulade with a bizarre over sweet filling which was really quite horrible. Failed experimental recipe!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience."
"Not Verified |  Overall excellent service and experience. Planes were clean, food was savoury, staff was very courteous, flights were on schedule. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an amazing experience, definitely the best airline IMHO."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came."
"✅ Trip Verified |  SIN to DOH on a Boeing 777. Older aircraft but very spacious and comfortable. Ordered Gluten Free Meal. Very delicious. Toilets and cleaned regularly Flight crew was fantastic. As for inflight entertainment, my favourite channel was the flight map. Although I prefer they cut the special effects and advertising and just show a plain and simple flight map. Loved their window seat at Economy. If you want to be first to enter the plane, make sure you sit at Zone 1. DOH to FRA on a B787. First thing I noticed was that the seat pitch was very narrow. Especially when the person in front leans their seat back. I feel very claustophobic. I will choose a B777 next time. I wanted to change my meal option from GFML to no special meal but the IOS app did not work. Even Android app and the website did not reflect the change I tried to make.  I was looking for ways to contact Qatar Airways about the error on their app but I can't find any form or email to report the error. My second Gluten Free Meal was a hard piece of bread, vegetarian meals are not healthy because they contain carbohydrates. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because I'm not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A direct flight to SIN would be easier, but we love Qatar Airways (QA). However, on both legs they let us down.  On the 1st leg various dishes and beverages were not available. Service for a couple in the middle seats is bothersome. The staff does not manage to serve the both of us at the same time, despite our request. We have made a lot of flights with QA over the last years and this is most of the time an issue. Staff was not very attentive.  On the 2nd leg it was much much better. However they conducted an aircraft change without assigning seats or give the opportunity to select seats. Staff and service was the expected level: attentive and nice. One notices clearly they are cutting costs and that influences the 5 star experience. The great staff compensates. The transfer was smooth: a wonderful lounge, a good shower. Also important: QA flies ‘on time’. That said: we will certainly fly QA again."
✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft unrefurbished. Tired and boring. Cabin crew excellent and service minded as always. But they forgot to load pj's for Business class.
✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time taking the midnight departure from Doha to the USA. Qatar Airways Qsuites are very good but the WI-FI is not good. Over seven flights I have taken since July the menu had been repeated which is shocking. The entertainment was very good and the pajamas commemorating the World Cup are quite unique I plan on saving them. The flight attendants were superb.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Male via Doha. The flight to Male was nice and we received good service. However, on our return flight from Doha to Miami we paid a little extra to chose our seats and ended up sitting next to a man who was more than 2 meters tall in a group of three seats. My wife ended up moving to a row of 4 seats with only one other passenger. My wife hit the flight attendant call button twice and was never checked on. We were only offered water twice outside of meals despite constant video reminders to ""Stay hydrated."" We ended up loitering in the galley chugging fluids, mostly water. At Doha before entering the gate, there was an additional security checkpoint where we were forced to dump two liters of water and there were no fountains or water refill stations before boarding. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely wonderful experience on all 3 flights with Qatar (Doha to Melbourne October 21 and Sydney-Doha-Montreal October 30/31) (4th was a code share with Air Canada. Amazing service pre-flight (both calls ahead of flight answered within 4 rings by a real person), on the ground and in the air. Seats were comfortable (enough so that on my return, and after 40+ years of regular flights to Asia and Africa I slept for the first time, and in each case for a long time). Had a window seat on the exit row each time, as pre-booked. Food was delicious - vegetarian or chicken choices were delicious, filling and fresh - unlike other airlines' meals, I did not feel heavy or greasy after the meal. I felt better rested and relaxed than I do when I fly to Australia from Toronto via the west coast (Vancouver, LA or Houston stops). Simply can't say enough great things about Qatar!"
Not Verified | We still had a voucher from our return flight during covid from Brussels to Colombo. We wanted to book a new flight but the voucher was valid until 2 days before we wanted to book a new flight. We've contacted Qatar and someone told us we would still be able to use this voucher but she had to check and we'd hear from Qatar within two days. We never heard from them again. We've called 10 times but nobody really helped us and everyone said something different. In the end we got an email address from the Qatar refund team but we've mailed already 3 times without a reply and one email was a fake one. We've always loved to fly with Qatar but this is terrible terrible customer service. And it seems we've now lost our 680 euros worth of flying.
"✅ Trip Verified | The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they don't care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (it's been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasn't worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better."
"✅ Trip Verified | The journey started on a rather bad note as the Air Canada Maple contract lounge is already closed for the evening FRA to DOH flight. So there will be no lounge access for the evening Qatar flight; something unheard of. When I approached the staff at the gate, they told me that they were not aware that the lounge closes at 16.45. Flight itself uneventful, with good service and catering, unfortunately no Qsuite. Arrival in Doha as almost always via a long bus transfer. Al Safa lounge as always impeccable. Flight to Bangkok in Qsuite, with again good service and catering. This time equipped with Qsuites."
"✅ Trip Verified |  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flight, very happy with the service we received right check in till disembarkation including the transit transportation in Doha. We had the shortest transit of 20 minutes. Special mention and thanks to Mr Tushar, Steward on QR028. He is the most efficient and kindest inflight staff we have ever met"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Enjoyed flying with Qatar Airways. Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you). This even happened after the boarding pass was issued. This has happened to us twice in 3 months, really hope it doesn't happen again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo return via Doha Another very pleasant flying experience with my favorite airline. Basic economy ticket. Great cabin crew, food was great well presented and most importantly something you can eat. Cabin crew attention to safety was fantastic. Rest rooms were well maintained. When I visited the galley to get a drink it was well maintained. "
✅ Trip Verified |  There was an aircraft change and they separated three in our family into three different sections. The seating was a 2-2-2 configuration instead of a 1-2-1. The USB ports were out of order and The TVs in the middle from rows 5 to 7 did not work. My seat adjustment keys were worn out and erratic and the TV screen was non-touch screens or did not work.  I do not know why they used such an old aircraft with many controls not working for a day flight of 13 hours. The lounge in Doha was exceptional both during outward and inward journeys. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have shown excellent professionalism. One silver lining is the crew aboard the aircraft was par excellence. They did a fantastic job as usual.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Superb airline with superb air hostesses, Can’t do enough and attend to every need, with quality service. On board meals and entertainment were great also. Just need to sort security times at Doha"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Today's experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In today’s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldn’t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didn’t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid £150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we weren’t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  No words to appreciate e-Customer support, cabin comfort, meals served, cabin crew positive attitude. Latest aircraft and On-time performance. I got upgraded to Business from Doha without any request which was a surprise for me so I remain happy and grateful to Qatar. "
✅ Trip Verified |  Amazing airline overall. Inflight service and very friendly staff is all you need during your flight. Arriving experience to the very well organised airport not waiting for your luggage was the brilliant way to end my journey. Thank you Qatar Airways.
✅ Trip Verified |  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is our second time flying with Qatar Airways. We flew LAX to DOH, stayed a few days and then onto CAI and back. From check in to in flight Qatar Airways makes it a truly wonderful experience. The check in at LAX was quick and friendly and don't even get me started on the experience of checking in at DOH; offered beverages, sit down and very attentive and friendly. The lounges are so relaxing, good food, drinks, the lounge at DOH has ""hotel"" rooms in it you can sleep in for a few hours. Service is top notch. Now for the flight. Warm greeting and welcome, Q Suites there are no words just comfortable, easy to sleep well in (I slept 10 hours). The amenity kit bags were colored for Breast Cancer awareness and the PJs for World Cup, awesome. The food was delicious as usual, flavorful, many choices, served at a good temperature and displayed nicely. They do have a new added light meal menu for world cup and it's like tailgate food; chips and guaq, potato ball, fish and chips, hamburger. I loved the idea, so fun and the execution was great. I hope they keep some of the items even after WC. World class experience that makes you look forward to flying for 16 hours!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The crew on both routes ZRH to DOH and DOH to Cebu were very friendly, helpful and fulfilled every wish. Thank you. Qatar Airways used leased aircraft from Cathay Pacific on the flight from Zurich to Doha that was not up to the usual Qatar Airways standard. It was rather an old aircraft. The seat light did not work and the flight itinerary on the information system was outdated and showed little info."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I don't really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I opted to have food at the Al Mourjan lounge before boarding, and to avoid it on the flight. This allowed me to enjoy the benefit of a good sleep, in the relative comfort of a business class flat bed. I opted for the last minute ""on the go breakfast"" before landing in Bangkok, proving the same inadequate level of F&B which I now associate with Qatar Airways: 3 or 4 pieces of fruit, a compote of yoghurt with some sugared jam, and a croissant. Harmless enough. Staff as always, very pleasant and willing to help at every opportunity, when required."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the return journey first leg. Inflight staff seemed better organised, but rather than risk a re-run of the chaotic F&B service on the inbound journey, I opted to sleep as soon as we had taken off, and not be disturbed for any F&B until or unless I decided I wanted it. This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags. Qatar need to seriously monitor the service they are contracting to Iberia."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent once onboard. Nice friendly service, on the mark. The salmon was very overdone and dry.  Lounge review separately, Menzies Executive Lounge that is awful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg was in First on a gorgeous A380, with impeccable service and great food and drinks. Stay at the Al Safah lounge In Doha was great as always. My connecting flight to FRA was at 1 pm, a very quiet time at Doha airport. Despite almost all gates unoccupied, the flight departed from a remote location by bus. It was the usual long wait and chaos at the bus gates, with a hot bus, and overheated plane with cannot cope with open doors on the tarmac. Service and food was ok, but there is no more sandwich service in business class before arrival on this 6h flight. I was offered potato chips or muesli bars, which I declined. I had a seat in row one, and was unable to sleep due to the loud chit chatting of the staff in the galley. Overall, what Qatar is struggling with is consistency on the ground and in the air."
Not Verified |  Rome was less than expected in terms of customer service. This made our trip quite frustrating. Qatar airways staff and the airport in Hamad made up for this. I recommend flying Qatar Airways. The hostesses were professional and friendly. They treated us like royalty and made sure we were comfortable. Highly recommended.
"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first flight with Qatar and it was the trip of a lifetime. I upgraded from Economy for a leg of the journey and from the very first minute the red carpet rolled out, the whole check-in and boarding process was done quickly, with ease and the attendants were all super friendly and very helpful. The seats were luxurious, supremely comfortable and made for a totally relaxed flight. The meals provided were the best I have ever had on any airline, truly 5 star cuisine, plenty of options and beautifully presented. I was delighted with the quality, service and price. Having travelled the globe on many different airlines, I cannot recommend Qatar highly enough, they truly are the World's Best Airline and will be my airline of choice from now on. Thankyou Qatar Airways for such a wonderful travelling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Both sectors of this flight had Qsuites. Which added to the attentive service by the staff (nothing is too much trouble) plus the quality & availability of the food + drinks are the reason why Qatar Airways business class is the best in the sky. Check-in and boarding is supper efficient for business class passengers, offers of welcome drinks / food options / pyjamas etc from pleasant staff make it a pleasure to fly this airline. There is a reason why Qatar Airways is consistently voted the best in the world and I wish I could afford to fly premium class all the time as it really is worth the extra cost."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them
"✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling on Qatar in nearly 4 years because of the pandemic. Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways. Overall the staff were trying to solve the problems, but they seemed unable to manage what should be their normal operation. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Immediately changed into provided ""PJs"", and after take off, had the mattress applied to the seat, and went to sleep. Had pre-ordered breakfast prior to arrival, which I was advised would be about 2 hours before decent. Slept well, and awoke about 4 hours later. Was immediately offered breakfast, and assumed it was at the agreed time. A fruit platter with yoghurt and juice was produced. Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid. Like all airlines, Qatar has suffered from the ill-effects of the pandemic, so they are cutting services, but not prices. Hugely disappointed, but hope they can return to the airline I much loved pre-pandemic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. "
"✅ Trip Verified | After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me I'd have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!"
✅ Trip Verified | Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all. 
✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Montreal. Exceptional service provided right from boarding to disembarking. The Q-Suite is a must try experience with delectable cuisine and attentive service from wonderful cabin crew. A special thank you to them on this flight!
✅ Trip Verified |  It’s always amazing experience flying with Qatar Airways especially a long haul flight. Very comfortable and one of the top notch are the cabin cres services and very attentive. Seat are very comfortable Q-suites. Lots of privacy.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew a service from Islamabad to Gatwick (London) via Doha. It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways. I hope to fly them soon again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. "
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. I've called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better."
"Not Verified |  I was very impressed with every aspect of my flights and I will fly again on Qatar, rather than my usual airline out of Australia. The service, food ,cleanliness and aircraft were excellent. The QSuites were luxurious and so comfortable for sleeping. I am a solo flyer, and not so young any more. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. I also used the Al Maha transit assistance which was brilliant."
"✅ Trip Verified | Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Great service at the Business/Privilege check-in counter and very helpful with fragile item. Boarding started 10min. late, reason unknown. Crew very helpful and friendly again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very well managed flight with friendly staff. There was a medical incident (passenger lost consciousness and was administered oxygen), which the crew managed well. It doesn’t need 3 crew members to assist someone in that state (I’m saying this as a first responder myself)."
✅ Trip Verified |  The service on Qatar Airways is excellent. I have flown with them several times and they have never let me down. They are consistent in maintaining high quality standards. Their cabin crew are the best. They treat all passengers with polite humility and they make you feel welcome on their aircraft. The aircraft itself is very comfortable and clean. They really deserve their award as best airline. I look forward to flying with them again.
"✅ Trip Verified | We've traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and don't get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still haven't received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I haven't received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they can't help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified |  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Platinum Member of QMiles and Emerald on the One World Alliance and have flown a lot on Qatar Airways. This year their catering service has been declining steadily and they need to sort this out, on this flight they had lobster thermidor, lamb chops and a weird vegetarian option , and by the fourth row in business class they had run out of the lobster. Our aircraft was a 12 year old 777-200LR these planes were meant to serve the DOH to AKL route which I flew on back in 2017 and the proposed Doha to Santiago de Chile route which never materialized, the plane was recently refurbished with QSuites but the WI-FI was very very patchy, The cabin crew tried their best but the plane was very full and were under a lot of stress. The snacks they offered were comparable to a less than two hour flight on a a domestic US route, a bar of chocolate or a pack of chips, the catering is deteriorating."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a breeze and then a long walk to the lounge. Once there it’s like dining in a private club, service was first rate and the cook to order menu was truly fantastic, due to the late departure I choose to eat in the lounge and sleep for most of the flight. Warm welcome on board and shown to my qsuite which I definitely prefer over their other products. Was given a welcome drink and pre ordered my breakfast with a request to be woken up 2.5 hours prior to landing. Breakfast was good but I have had better. Service is friendly and effective this is still one of the top products out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787's too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didn't offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasn't booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didn't offer me any cash compensation. "
"Not Verified |  Only my second time using Qatar, first was in 2008. It is still good, but they have places to improve. First leg was great, and ground staff very accommodating to my need for an exit seat due to my height, really appreciated that. Seats are very comfortable and recline a surprising amount. I never am able to sleep on flights but I fell asleep straight away. Loads of great movies to watch, food was good, staff excellent. My second leg was not good, but only for one reason the food/staff. I requested a specific meal due to allergies, but it was not on the list or assigned to my seat. When they came round with the trolley I told her I requested a special meal, she almost didn't understand or know what to do, she said she'd talk to someone ... 20mins went by, no one spoke to me, so I flagged someone down, she'd forgotten. Then all of a sudden 4 of then scramble around and took them a further 25mins to put half a luke warm meal together, a bread roll and two cups of fruit. The attendant either was new or had no clue what she was doing. Even when I asked for a beer she started listing every other drink until I asked 2 more times for a beer until she understood. . I am flying with Qatar in 3 weeks time, hopefully this won't happen again. It is a great airline, but still some room for improvement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Bangkok-Doha 11 Sept. 2022 on the flagship of the skies, the A380. Check-In smooth. Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable. Luggage well-handled and arrived to final destination with their partner airline, Rwandair, without any issues. Lounge in Doha, Silverlounge, was acceptable, due to attentive staff and tarmac view. Ticket were not that expensive."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The lie-flat seat on Business Class made for a good night's sleep. The cabin crew were prompt and attentive with service and this was consistent throughout all legs of the journey, where snacks, water and other beverages were provided in addition to meal service. The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point. Certainly can consider flying with Qatar Airways again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. I traveled with my 86 year old mother. Qatar Airways staff made it extremely comfortable both for my mom and me. The staff were  courteous and caring, making our travel a breeze. I felt compelled to give a high rating for the flight comfort and staff's effort to make it even better. Unfortunately, the website was not user friendly to post the review there. Flight also arrived about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. This is the 3rd time I am flying with Qatar Airways. They always made my travel very comfortable. Look forward to taking another Qatar flight real soon. Good luck to them and their staff!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Morning departure from Charles de Gaulle the plane offered QSuites, the WiFi was working but barely. The service was lower than the normal Qatar Airways high standard but my food was awful. My Salmon was clearly farmed and my lobster was raw the only edible thing was the berries. How could they get it so wrong?"
"Not Verified | New York to Bucharest via Doha. On August 27, this year, I flew with Qatar from New York to Doha. It happened that during the flight, it was my husband's birthday, so I dared to ask a stewardess, if possible, at a certain time, to bring me two glasses of anything, so that I could wish my husband a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The surprise was so big, both for me and for my husband, because I sent an improvised mini cake and two prosecco glasses."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire trip was enjoyable. Boarding in Nigeria was hitch-free. Cabin crew attitude was excellent all through the flight. The layover at Doha, although long, was calm due to the airport aesthetics. Same can be said about the return leg of the journey. Overall, Qatar Airways is an excellent airline."
✅ Trip Verified |  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting from the check-in at Tunis Airport Ms Nesrine welcomed me and my family with a big smile and she was very helpful asking for the travel documents. In 3 minutes, the check-in ended after registering our 8 luggages.  In the first flight, it was very comfortable and secure, the hostess were very kind. In Doha airport, the problem where we can take a rest of 10 hours.  The second flight were perfect too with a very good service."
✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways business class is truly a flying experience. Very good crew and the head crew Michelle and her team Ashwini Bhise were excellent. I am a frequent flyer both in Qatar and Emirates but Qatar stand out in quality of service. the Transfer desk at Doha is very professional and dedicated team.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Hamad International Airport and Hamad Medical Corporation about my medical health. I had a bleeding from varicose veins of right leg, immediately they took action and transferred me to the Hamad Medical Corporation with my sister and took care of the situation and they made sure I was stable and I could walk without pain. Thank you to all the staff at Hamad International Airport and all the doctors and nurses at Hamad Medical Corporation. Dr Abdul Jaleel Palakkunnummal Muhammed a specialist who took care of the situation."
"✅ Trip Verified | Vienna to Jakarta via Doha. Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all. It just disappeared."
"✅ Trip Verified | We got on a 4 year old Boeing 777-300 equipped with QSuites fully booked the seats are comfortable and operated properly and the WI-FI worked but Turkey does not allow WI-FI in it’s airspace so a good three hours was without internet, IFE was very good, the lamb chops were the worst I have had but the rest of the food was good. Service was barely acceptable but I will give them some slack with so many passengers but them letting children run riot in business class was unacceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Islamabad to Manchester via Doha. Once again Qatar don’t fail to amaze me. Quality service from calling privilege direct number to change flight location and date, to check-in and Crew. Excellent manners and Qsuite clean and comfortable. First time since March 2020 travelled for work with Qatar and with loyalty shown to customers in extending tier levels since covid, this demonstrates customers aren't just a number. Well done Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified |  No doubt named the best airlines for consecutive years. The services are excellent and the cabin crew are very well mannered and friendly. Every time I travel to Asia it’s my first airline option to choose. Business class seats are good.
"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight to Nairobi on August 13 but returning to San Diego (the second leg) was disappointing. The crew for the leg from Doha to Dallas was underwhelming.  I did not get the cabin attendants name but she was inattentive and rude. I called for her via the light and each time I waited over 45 minutes and still had to get up w/ a 2 year old and go find her to get milk for him. The other guy working our side of the plane was the same. He walked by me multiple times while I had the call light on and did not acknowledge me. I do want to shout out a Qatar employee (I wish I got her name) but she was by the baggage claim in Dallas and she was so helpful. I was traveling by myself with a 2 year old and she helped to get my luggage and roll it to the re check bag area. I am so grateful for her. Also another attendant on my Nairobi to Doha leg, he was so helpful. Helped me with me bags and even had an airport attendant carry my bags and get me a ride to security. That was the service I was expecting on the Doha to Dallas leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft change meant that although I was still on an A350 this one was without the Qsuite which was a shame but seems to more common problem with Qatar. The family that was expecting a quad had more problems as one of the kids didn’t like sitting apart from the parents, which is one of the benefits of the product. Flight was really good with service by Gabriel first rate. Dine on demand is really good however as the flight lands at 9:30 in the morning a breakfast option would have been good instead of all being based around dinner. Selection of food good, flight comfortable, even managed fours of sleep."
Not Verified |  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Qatar Airways uses the Boeing 777-300 ER on its Philadelphia route. The planes are not as modern and spacious as the A50s which used to be on this route. The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.  Overall, good and professional airline with a respectable inflight product despite the pandemic related cost cutting."
✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting.
